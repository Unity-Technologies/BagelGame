# Bagel Game

You're a bagel...

You need to get to the toaster before you go stale _while_ still having toppings left. A physics-based balance between speed and precision.

Bagel Game is a full vertical game project that is specifically made to demonstrate how UI Toolkit can be used to create UI for 3D games.

It covers:
* World Space UI
* Custom Shaders
* Filters
* Data Bindings
* UXML/USS
* Themes
* Input System Integration
* ...and more!
